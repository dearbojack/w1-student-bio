        <h1>About Me - Dali Han</h1>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Dali. I'm from China, and I live in the UK now. Currently, I'm trying to learn Front-end webdevelopment systematically in the <em>BOOTCAMP</em>!</p>
        <p>I learned some basics <strong>by myself</strong> before, but still lack the systematic understanding of the whole.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>- Worked as a freelance translator & interpretor, translated 3 books and published 2;</ul>
        <ul>- Worked as a outsource interpreter at a game development studio in ByteDance @ Hangzhou;</ul>
        <ul>- Worked as an in-house training specialist and trainer of soft-skill topics for about 5 years;</ul>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>- Writing & translating;</ul>
        <ul>- Programming & messing around with Linux;</ul>
        <ul>- Playing games and watching E-sports events;</ul>

        <h2>Games</h2>
        I like playing games and I think some of them are truly <strong>art</strong>. Of all the games I played, I think the best ones are:
        <ol>Dark Souls</ol>
        <ol>The Witcher 3</ol>
        <ol>It Takes Two</ol>

        <em>To name just a few.</em> I think playing good games is like reading good novels or experiencing some other people's lives. We can only live once, but it doesn't mean we can only <em>live</em> once. 
        <br>
        <p style="color: red;">Thus my motto is:</p>
        <h2>Play More, Live More</h2>
